I am a data scientist in the making, looking for patterns in neural time
series. One of my current research projects aims to discover recurrent
waveforms in multi-day continuous epileptic electrocorticographic (ECoG)
recordings that can be used to build interpretable features for seizure
prediction. I am interested in the development and application of unsupervised
and interpretable machine learning methods to neuroimaging data, with the goal
of extracting physiologically meaningful patterns that can help neuroscientists
advance our understanding of the brain.

I did my B.E. in Electrical Engineering and my M.Sc.Eng. at the [Universidad de
Antioquia][UDEA] ([Colombia][COL]), with a concentration in digital signal
processing and digital communications. I am currently a senior Ph.D. student at
the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering][ECE] of the University
of Delaware, under the supervision of Dr. [Austin J.  Brockmeier][AJB]. More
broadly, I enjoy developing and applying mathematical and computational methods
to solve problems.
