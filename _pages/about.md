I am a data scientist with a passion for the development and application of statistical and computational methods to understand and solve complex problems. I have a strong background in digital signal processing, training and research experience with unsupervised and supervised learning methods, experience with data wrangling and data cleaning of large (>2TB) data sets, and with the execution of experiments in high-performance clusters using Slurm and batch scripts. I also have extensive experience as a Linux user and administrator. In general, I like to strike a balance between a solid theoretical understanding of the mathematical methods and the software development needed to solve problems.

I am currently developing data-driven methods to discover recurrent
waveforms in multi-day continuous epileptic electrocorticographic (ECoG)
recordings, with the goal of building features that can be used for seizure prediction and that can also be easily interpreted by neuroscientists. This work represents a novel approach to the analysis of neural time series that can offer not only predictive power but also new insights for the study of the brain physiology.

<!--- I am interested in the development and application of unsupervised and interpretable machine learning methods to neuroimaging data, with the goal of extracting physiologically meaningful patterns that can help neuroscientists advance our understanding of the brain. -->

I did my B.E. in Electronics Engineering and my M.Sc.Eng. at the [Universidad de
Antioquia][UDEA] ([Colombia][COL]), with a concentration in digital signal
processing and digital communications. I am currently a senior Ph.D. student at
the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering][ECE] of the University
of Delaware, with expected graduation date of May 2022, and under the supervision of Dr. [Austin J.  Brockmeier][AJB].
